====================

This is an implementation of `GitHub-Flavored Markdown`_ written as an
extension to the Python `Markdown`_ library. It aims for maximal
compatibility with GitHub's rendering.

py-gfm code is under a BSD-style :ref:`license <license>`.

Installation
------------

::

   pip install py-gfm

Quick start
-----------

All-in-one extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   import markdown
   from mdx_gfm import GithubFlavoredMarkdownExtension

   source = """
   Hello, *world*! This is a ~~good~~marvelous day!
   Here is an auto link: https://example.org/

   Le me introduce you to [task lists](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments):

   - [ ] eggs
   - [x] milk

   You can also have fenced code blocks:

   ```python
   import this
   ```
   """

   # Direct conversion:
   html = markdown.markdown(
       source, extensions=[GithubFlavoredMarkdownExtension()])

   # Factory-like:
   md = markdown.Markdown(extensions=[GithubFlavoredMarkdownExtension()])
   html = md.convert(source)

   # By module name (not recommended if you need custom configs):
   html = markdown.markdown(source, extensions=['mdx_gfm'])

Ã€ la carte
~~~~~~~~~~

::

   import markdown
   from gfm import AutolinkExtension, TaskListExtension

   html = markdown.markdown(
       source, extensions=[AutolinkExtension(),
                           TaskListExtension(max_depth=2)])

Available extensions
--------------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   lib/index

Modules
-------

.. toctree::
   :titlesonly:

   module/gfm
   module/mdx_gfm
   module/mdx_partial_gfm

Supported features
------------------

-  Fenced code blocks
-  Literal line breaks
-  Tables
-  Hyperlink parsing (``http``, ``https``, ``ftp``, ``email`` and
   ``www`` subdomains)
-  Code highlighting for code blocks if Pygments_ is available
-  Mixed-style lists with no separation
-  Strikethrough
-  Task lists

.. _Pygments: https://pypi.org/project/Pygments/

Unsupported features
--------------------

This implementation does not support all of GFM features and has known
differences in how rendering is done.

-  By design, link to commits, issues, pull requests and user profiles are not
   supported since this is application specific. Feel free to subclass the
   provided classes to implement your own logic.
-  There is no emoji support.
-  There is no horizontal rule (``---`` ie. ``<hr>``) support.
-  Nested lists are not behaving exactly like GitHub's: `issue #10`_.
-  Contrary to GitHub, only double-tilde'd text renders strikethrough, not single-tile'd: `issue #14`_.

.. _`issue #10`: https://github.com/Zopieux/py-gfm/issues/10
.. _`issue #14`: https://github.com/Zopieux/py-gfm/issues/14
